## By Roster Upload (recommended)
    ### 1. Email your roster (must include member names and phone numbers) to help@doorlist.app
    Please include the name of the organization, the name and phone number of the primary admin, and the name of the school.

## By Phone Number or Contact 
### 1. Toggle to the members tab of the organization admin page
### 2. Tap the '+' and either enter a members phone number or tap the contact button to add them by contact
# 
## By Join Code or Link
    ### 1. Toggle to the members tab of the organization admin page
    ### 2. Tap the '+' and select the 'Share Link or Code' button
    ### 3. Enter your join code and set an expiration date for the code
    The code will not be active until you select an expiration date.
    ### 4. Share code directly or share code via link with organization membership
    Organization members will tap the + on the profile page, select join organization and enter the code. If you chose to share a link, once members have signed up for DoorList, clicking the link will automatically add them to your organization.
